service.mfa.unrecognized.authn.method.header=Unrecognized authentication method
service.mfa.unrecognized.authn.method.message=You&rsquo;re trying to log in to <strong>'{0}'</strong> using <strong>'{1}'</strong>. \
Unfortunately, the Central Authentication Service doesn&rsquo;t recognize that authentication method and so does not know how to proceed.</p> \
<p>This is probably a configuration problem either in the application you&rsquo;re trying to log into or in CAS itself. This problem has been logged \
so that it is available for CAS server administrators to review; you may also wish to <a href="https://help.evergreen.edu">report this issue</a>.</p> \
<p>If you&rsquo;re a developer or CAS administrator seeing this message: the <code>authn_method</code> request parameter had a value not matching any declared \
in CAS&rsquo;s <code>argumentExtractorsConfiguration.xml</code>. Verify the agreement between the CAS-using application and the CAS server about what custom authentication \
methods are available and what they&rsquo;re called.
